    <!-- Introduction to technique -->
    <p>
        Throwing a disc properly requires an adequate amount of spin, and speed on a disc.
        It is essential that each player develops their own form, as everyone is built a little
        differently. There are general do's and don'ts, however, so here are a few.
    </p>

    <!-- Basic shot types -->
     <div>
        <p>
            There are many different ways discs can be thrown to achieve different results, however,
            the main to shot types are forehand, and backhand. Forehand shots resemble those of baseball
            players throwing side-armed, whereas backhand shots are closer to a typical frisbee throw.
            Discs as it turn out fly very different than frisbees, so it can be very bizarre at first.
        </p>
     </div>

    <!-- Grip -->
    <div>
        <p>
            Having a solid grip is important to releasing the disc at the right time with the desired
            amount of spin. Generally, for any longer backhand throws, it's best to hold the disc with all four
            fingers against the inner rim of the disc, fairly tightly. Forehand grip techniques vary more,
            as everyone has differently shaped hands and fingers. Finding something comfortable is difficult
            but important for the forehand. The bottom line is that when swinging through, you need your
            palm facing in the direction you wish to throw. Having the pads of your fingers against the
            inner rim of the disc is generally accepted as a good way of doing this.
        </p>   
    </div>

    <!-- Swing -->
    <div>
        <p>
            Having a smooth and confident swing ensures that the disc will go the correct direction on
            the desired angle. "Swing plane" is a term used to reference the path traced by your shoulders
            during a shot. Maintaining your swing plane is necessary for a predictable and repeatable
            shot.
