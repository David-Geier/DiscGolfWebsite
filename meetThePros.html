        <dt>1. Simon Lizotte</dt>
        <dd>PDGA# 8332</dd>
        <p>
            Simon Lizotte is a long-time pro tour player who moved from Germany to the United
            States when he was sixteen years old, to pursue competitive disc golf. Very
            quickly, he became a fan favorite as a flashy player who is not afraid to 
            take risks out on the course. Simon Lizotte currently holds the world record
            for the world's fastest disc throw at 89.5 miles per hour.

        <dt>2. Eagle McMahon</dt>
        <dd>PDGA# 37817</dd>
        <p>
            Aptly named, Eagle has been shooting low scores since his entrance to the sport.
            Long ago Simon and Eagle were both signed by Discmania, where they took the tour
            by storm. They were quickly named "The Crushboys" by fans, as they both had
            monster drives. Eagle is another fan favorite similar to Simon in his ability to
            think outside the box, and use his excess of power for creative shots that stun
            the crowds and competition

    <div class="meetTheProsDiv">
        <dt>3. Paul McBeth</dt>
        <dd>PDGA# 27523</dd>
        <p>
            Paul "the beast" McBeth, has been making the game look simple for a very long time.
            With an intelligent game plan, well-rounded throwing ability, and lights-out putting,
            you can never count the six-time world champion out until the very end. Aside from
            winning the World Championship in six different years, Paul Macbeth is also known
            for shooting multiple "perfect" (18 under) rounds. He is truly a legend in the sport.
